This set of exercises will give everyone some practice with the
basics of defining functions in Racket and more experience with
[the DrRacket development environment](https://racket-lang.org). These
are crucial building blocks that will form the foundation of everything that
will happen in this course, so start early and ask lots of questions.

Please test all your programs carefully and include all the test cases
with your program. **You must have at least 3 `check-expect` tests for
each function.**

See the Canvas site for examples of solving similar exercises, and for info on
how to submit your work.
