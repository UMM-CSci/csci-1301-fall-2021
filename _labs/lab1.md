In this lab we're going to work in groups of 2 or (in a few cases) 3, getting
some hands-on experience with the [DrRacket programming environment](https://racket-lang.org)
and exploring both the Racket language and the DrRacket environment.
Before you can do that, though, you'll also need to learn a few things
about using our computer science lab, so we'll start by getting you set up
on our gear.

# Getting set up in our lab

While the "programming" part of the lab will be done in groups, we need
_everyone_ to do some of the initial setup. In particular _everyone_ should
be given a chance to login and change their password before groups get
started on the lab exercises.

Before you can start on the lab, everyone needs to log in to a lab computer
and change your password. Because there are more people than computers, groups
will need to let everyone on a team take turns doing this part. **It's
important that everyone get through this part, so be patient and help each
other out.**

## Log in

To log in you'll need a user name and a password:

   * Your user name in our lab
   is the same as your usual university login name, so use the same user
   name you would use to log in to the unversity systems like e-mail and
   Canvas. (Note that this *doesn't* include the `@morris.umn.edu` part.)
   * Your initial password will follow a scheme described in class, and you'll
   then change that as described below.

## REMEMBER TO LOGOUT!

When you are done with your work at the end of the lab session (or just after
changing your password), *don't forget to log out!* Click on
the "power" button in the upper-right corner of your main monitor, then
on the triangle by your name, then select "log out". If you don't log
out, your account will be accessible to others and you may also have
problems when you later try to log in to another machine in the lab.

## Find some key programs

Once you're logged in, you'll want to find three important programs
that we'll use all semester long:

   * A `terminal` (it serves as a command prompt)
   * DrRacket
   * A web browser; we have both Chrome and Firefox installed, and either
     should work fine.

To find one of these programs press the "Windows" key on your keyboard or click
on "Activities" in the left upper corner of your screen. You can then use the
search bar to find the program you're looking for. double-clicking on it should
start it up, and if you right-click on it you can add it to your "favorites"
in the Activities list so you won't have to search for it again in the future.

## Changing your password

**We will check that you've changed your passwords**, and your group will receive
or lose points depending on whether *everyone* in the group has changed their
passwords.

Open a terminal window by double-clicking on the `terminal` program in
"Activities". That terminal window should give you a prompt that will allow
you to run commands, such as:

   * `whoami` should print out your username
   * `hostname` should show you the name of the computer you're sitting at
   * `date` should show you the current date and time

There are _bazillions_ of other commands, but we won't go over them here. If
you're interested there are numerous good sources out there for learning more
about Linux command line tools such as [this tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBokz0LTizk), or
even old-fashioned things like books.

What we need to do right now, however, is change your password. Our CSci lab
systems use an entirely separate login system from the U's other systems like
e-mail, so changing your password in the lab doesn't have any impact on the U's
system and vice versa. You _can_ choose to (for now) have the same password
for both systems, but that's not required and they won't be kept in sync by
either of the systems. Do make an effort to choose a reasonably secure password.
A fairly secure method of generating a password you can actually remember later
is to pick 4 unrelated words and run them together; an example (**which you
shouldn't use**) might be `setup-beggar-peony-federal`.

![XKCD on password strength](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

To actually change your password type the command `passwd`.
You will be prompted to type in your
current password (the one following the pattern described in class) and then
the new password twice. *For security reasons nothing shows on the
screen as you are typing your password*. If you make a mistake, press
Ctrl-C to stop the process and start over.

**Make sure to remember your new password, otherwise you won't be able
to log in next time you use the lab.** We can reset your password, but we can't
ever tell you what your password actually is.

If you encounter any problems (such as your login not working), please
let us know right away.

# Get started in Racket

After *everyone* in your group has changed their password, it's time to get
started on the Racket part of the lab. One member of your group should be
logged in, but it doesn't really matter which. Whoever is logged in should
open a browser, and then bring up this lab. (You can either get the URL from
us, or login to [Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu) and go through the link there.

## Open some documentation

You should also open another few tabs with some bits of Racket documentation
you'll likely find useful as you work on the lab:

   * [The Racket "Beginning Student" language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html)
      * This includes documentation of all the functions provided in that version of
   Racket, including `check-expect` and things like `max` and `gcd` that are
   part of exercises below.
   * [The image library documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html)
      * This documents all the image manipulation and creation functions that
      you'll need for some of the exercises below.

## Organize your files (optional)

The picture of a file cabinet in Activities opens a window that lets you
see and manipulate the files in your home space. If you wish, you can use this
to create folders and subfolders help organize your files. You could, for
example, create a "CSci1301" folder for the files you'll generate in this
course, or create a "Courses" folder and create "CSci1301" inside that.

## Start DrRacket

If necessary, find DrRacket again (see above) and start it up.

You may also start DrRacket by double-clicking on a Racket
file, including one you download such as [example.rkt](../example.rkt) or
one of the examples on Canvas.

### Make sure language is set correctly

Make sure that the language is
set to "Beginning student". If it's not, go to the "Language" menu
and choose "Beginning Student".
Also, if you have troubles accessing image
functions (in problem 3) then go to \"Language -\> Add Teachpack\" and
add \"2htdp\\image.rkt\" *from the middle column*.

If you have accidentally added the teachpack from the first column, you
will be getting error messages when using image functions such as
`rotate`, either that the function definition is not found or that a
module has been imported twice. If this is happening, clear both
`image.rkt` teachpacks and then add the one in the middle column.

### Start the lab

You will use a pair-programming
approach: one person is a _driver_ at the keyboard and type in program
instructions; and the other person is a _navigator_ and guides the
driver by providing suggestions about what to type and what to do next.
The roles should be switched
every 10-15 minutes. For this lab it will be convenient to switch at the
end of each exercise.

If you are working in a group of three, the roles
are: a _driver_, a _navigator_, and a _quality control_ person.
Again, make sure to switch frequently.

Start your lab by typing a comment in the beginning of the file with the
lab number and the names (first and last) of all group members. Recall
that Racket comments are lines that start with `;` (a semicolon).

In order to save a file go to "File -\> Save
Definitions Asâ€¦" and navigate to your folder. Make sure to save your
file with the extension `.rkt`. After you've done it once you can just
use "Save" (or Ctrl-S) to save the file.

The lab below will have several parts. You may do all your work in one file,
or you may do different parts in different files, whichever you
find more convenient. Make sure to submit all your files, however.

### Problem 1: Infix to prefix conversion. (8 points)

Write Racket expressions that correspond to the given math expressions.
Check your answers by running the program, or, even better, by using
`check-expect`.

For instance, if are given `3 * (12/4 + 2)`, you rewrite it as a Racket
expression as `(* 3 (+ (/ 12 4) 2))`. Run it to check the answer, or,
better yet, figure out the answer before running the code, and use
`check-expect` to confirm your answer:

```racket
    (check-expect (* 3 (+ (/ 12 4) 2)) 15)
```

Below are math expressions to write in Racket:

1.  `1.5 * 2 + 21/3`
2.  `(3 + 2 + 7)/(11 - 1 - 4)`
3.  `(3*(-2 +4))/(8/2 + sqrt(4))`
4.  `cos(0) + sin(0)`, where `cos` and `sin` are the cosine and sine
    functions, respectively.
       * `cos` and `sin` are both provided as functions in Racket; [see the
       documentation for details](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#%28part._.Trigonometric_.Functions%29).

### Problem 2: testing Racket functions. (9 points)

Find out what the following Racket functions do by testing them on
different arguments:

   1. `<=`
   2. `max`
   3. `gcd`

Questions you might explore include:

   * What happens if a function is applied to more than two
arguments? Fewer than two?
   * What kinds of arguments are acceptable? Numbers? Strings? Booleans? Images?

Document your experiments and conclusions in your ".rkt" file.
Include all of tests that you tried as you worked to determine what
the function does. If you try an experiment that leads to an error, leave that
experiment in your write-up, but put that expression in a comment so it
doesn't break things when you run your file.

Explain your findings in comments. You may read the
function descriptions
[in the on-line documentation](http://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html)
if you would like, but the descriptions of the functions that you submit.

### Problem 3: creating a shape. (8 points)

Your task is to use functions in the
`image.rkt` teachpack
to create a particular shape. [The on-line documentation for `image.rkt`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html) should be useful.

The target shape is 200 pixels on each side and looks like this:

![Target image for Problem 3 of Lab 1](../assets/images/lab1.png)

There are different ways of creating this shape. Some functions that you
may find helpful include:
`square`, `triangle`, `right-triangle`, `rectangle`, `rhombus`, `rotate`,
`overlay`, `beside`, and `above`.

Use variables as you find useful. For example, if you are using an image
more than once, you might want to save it in a variable. Good use of
variables is one of the criteria used for evaluating your work.

Do not use `check-expect` for images here.
`check-expect` can sometimes work for images,
but it tends to be *very* finicky and dependent
on the details of how an image is constructed.
As a consequence it's common for two images that
_look_ the same fail the `check-expect` test
because a few pixels are off by a wee bit.

### Problem 4: explore Racket. (6 points)

Test three "what if" questions of your choice in Racket. For example,
you might want to try applying the `+` function to strings. Write down what
you think is going to happen, test it, and write down if that was what
you expected. If an expression that you test results in an error,
comment it out before you move on to the next one so it won't break things
when you (or we) run your file.
