# CSci 1301, Fall 2018, [University of Minnesota, Morris](https://www.morris.umn.edu)

Web presence for Fall 2018 edition of CSci 1301 at the [University of Minnesota, Morris](https://www.morris.umn.edu).

These materials were initially generated over several years by @elenam
[as "raw" HTML files](http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/1301fall2018/index.html).
@mcphee then converted the materials from HTML to Markdown with pandoc, and then
stuffed everything into a Jekyll install for deployment [on GitHub Pages](https://umm-csci.github.io/csci-1301-fall-2021/).
